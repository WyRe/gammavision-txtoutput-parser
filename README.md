# GammaVision output parser

This script parses output `.txt` files from GammaVision spectroscopy software, It does convert those files to a long format much more treatable from statistic point of view.

The more appropriate way to treat this output files should be using R, however this script does clean that info and rearrange the values in a long format. Then you are gonna be able to treat those values with any kind of statistical software.
